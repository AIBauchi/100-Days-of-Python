# Demo
here is a sample day 1 demo and the git commands to add it to the repository:

## Day 1: Introduction to Python
Welcome to Day 1 of the 100 Days of Python challenge! Today, we will introduce you to the basics of the Python programming language.

## Task

_Write a Python program that prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console._

## Solution

```python

print("Hello, World!")

```
## Git Commands
Assuming you have already created a Git repository and added a README.md file, you can use the following commands to add this solution to the repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Create a new file called day1.py and add the solution code to it.
3. Stage the changes to be committed:

```bash
git add day1.py
```

4. Commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Add solution for Day 1"
```

5. Push the changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```
